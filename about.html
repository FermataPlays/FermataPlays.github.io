                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Lauren Barry. I'm an 18 year old Computer Science student.
                </p>
                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm extremely passionate about music. I've been playing piano since I was 3 and a half years old, playing anything ranging from classical music to pop songs. As far as listening goes, my tastes are very wide. I usually describe my music preferences as, "Anything but country". However, some of my favorite genres are rock, rap, metal, hip-hop/R&B, 80s rock, and sometimes pop.
                 </p>
                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <p>
                    I've been interested in technology from a very young age. At age 9, I built my own computer for a school project. I was first introduced to Computer Science in middle school, when I tried to mod one of my favorite video games at the time. Since then, I've been exposed to a lot of different technologies, and there's still a lot more to explore. I've had great experiences working with topics such as low-level languages (Java is my personal favorite), networking, and development tools like Git and Maven. I'm currently trying to learn more about front-end development, new libraries, and game development.
                </p>
                <h4>Football</h4>
                <p>
                    Football (American Football, that is) is my favorite sport! Being raised in Seattle, I'm a huge Seahawks fan. I taught myself how the game works, and now consider myself to be extremely knowledgeable, especially about the rulebook (fouls are fun to disect, I've found!). One thing I'd really love to learn more about is playcalling and the structure of different offensive and defensive schemes.
