                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Lauren Barry. I'm an 18 year old Computer Science student. 
                </p>
                <h4>Music</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm extremely passionate about music. I've been playing piano since I was 3 and a half years old, playing anything ranging from classical music to pop songs. As far as listening goes, my tastes are very wide. I usually describe my music preferences as, "Anything but country". However, some of my favorite genres are rock, rap, metal, hip-hop/R&B, 80s rock, and sometimes pop.
                 </p>
                <h4>Technology</h4>
                <p>
                    I've been interested in technology from a very young age. At age 9, I built my own computer. I was first introduced to Computer Science in middle school, when I tried to mod one of my favorite video games at the time. 
                </p>
                <h4>Food</h4>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite things is eating good food! I have a fairly wide range of tastes, but my favorite foods are anything from an ethnic cuisine. Some of my favorites are Vietnamese, Thai, and Mexican.
