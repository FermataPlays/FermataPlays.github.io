            <h3>What is Bash?</h3>
            <p>
                Bash is a Discord bot. It was created in order to automate tests for another Discord bot, <a href="https://avairebot.com/">AvaIre</a>.
                It is part of a project for the Quality Assurance in Software Development class at Whitworth University, instructed by Pete Tucker. Bash's current home is on a small DigitalOcean Ubuntu server.
            </p>
            <p>
                AvaIre is an open-source Discord bot that is used on over 25,000 Discord servers. In order to run our automated tests, we needed to self-host (that is, make our own copy of the bot, instead of the publically available version) so that it could respond to our own bot (Bash). This quickly became more difficult, as AvaIre requires an SQL database in order to function properly. So, I created an AWS RDS instance to run a MySQL database. From there I further developed Bash to load Test Cases from various JSON files, execute them, and evaluate their results. Bash also includes a few quality of life commands that perform functions such as mass-deleting spammy messages and running tests.
            </p>
            <h3>About AvaIre</h3>
            <p>
                AvaIre is an open-source Discord bot. It has a variety of functions that range from administration (banning and kicking users), utilities like calculators and random number generation, entertainment, and music players. It performs all of its functions over text chat on the Discord VoIP/Chat platform, except for its music capabilities, which is through Discordâ€™s VoIP channels.
            </p>
            <h3>Testing Automation</h3>
            <p>
                AvaIre interacts with its users through text commands. That is, it receives a specific command through text chat, and responds in text chat. Without automation by using Bash, the only way to run tests would be to manually type in chat commands. This would be extremely tedious both to execute and to evaluate tests to ensure their success.
